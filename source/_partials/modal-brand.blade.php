                <p>Brand Prefabs are responsible for generating the brands visible within the game, which appear on Commercial and Industrial businesses.
                    Use this form to create your own company brands.</p>
                <p>Once you've finished creating a brand, import your custom creation into the game by placing the Prefab file in the Cities: Skylines II user data folder.
                    Additionally, ensure you have a CID (Component Identifier) for your custom content.</p>
                <p>After completing these steps, you can publish your company as an Asset Pack Manager package in PDX Mods.
                    But simply uploading the brand without incorporating other objects associated with it is not recommended.</p>
