# Cities: Skylines II Prefab Maker

Making building Prefab in game is easy. You plop it to the map, edit to your heart's content and save. You get your custom asset shipped ready for publishing.

But for non ploppable items, it's a pain to do where you need to assign the Brand or Zone to a building, then save that building to get the item.

To avoid that, I created this repo. You can visit it [here](https://qstar-inc.github.io/cities2-PrefabMaker/).
